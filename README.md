Generating MNIST data using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

GAN, when used to generate images with the help of a deep convolutional network, is termed as DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network). Hence, all the properties of basic GAN are applied to DCGAN in the same manner. 

A DCGAN works similarly to GAN, but it specifically focuses on using convolutional neural networks in the place of those fully-connected networks. As you learnt earlier, conv nets, in general, find areas of correlation within an image, that is, they look for spatial correlations.

This means that a DCGAN would likely be more fitting for the image or video data. Whereas, the general idea of a GAN can be applied to wider domains, as the model specifics are left to be addressed by the individual model architectures.


In this small project, new artificial MNIST data is generated using the existing MNIST digits using a Deep Convolutional GAN.
